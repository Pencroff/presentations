# Reveal.Jade - Reveal.js slides in Jade v.0.0.1

## Installation
* git clone
* (install grunt-cli and bower globally if you have not)Status
* npm install
* bower install
* grunt watch
* go to localhost:9001 with your browser
* edit src/jade/index.jade 

## Goal

This project aims to provide a pleasant 'build system' for making reveal.js slides using Grunt as the build
system and Jade as the templating language.

## ToDo (incomplete)
* clean up Grunt build
* make directory structure more organized
* externalize reveal configuration
* provide a way to work with / build themes (maybe with LESS?)
* more mixins
* etc etc
