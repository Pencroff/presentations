            Look at this code. It's amazing:
        +code("javascript").
            if (true) {
                console.log("lol");
                function omg () {
                   console.log("heollo");
                }
            }
    +slide('Fragment list example')
        +ul(["these", "are revealed", "one after another"], true)

    +slide()
        +slide("Vertical slide 1")
            p.
                Going down...
        +slide("Vertical slide 2")
            p.

    +slide-md().
